Pastry Shop Website Development:

The technologies used:

React.js: Js framework for building user interfaces, which facilitates the creation of reusable UI components.

React Redux:for state management, enabling efficient handling of the application state.

React Router DOM: A routing library for React applications, allowing for smooth navigation and the creation of single-page web applications.

Designed and coded a pastry shop website using React.js, taking a hands-on approach to crafting all functionalities from carousels to the gallery and the submission form,without relying on already coded designs. This project also served as my initial attempt at integrating Redux for state management. 
I strived to achieve a modern and visually appealing design by implementing color theory and drawing inspiration from the design principles employed by some of the most renowned websites.

However, it's important to note that the current iteration is a front-end-only project, lacking responsiveness. 
Moreover, there is no integration with a database, content management system (CMS), or APIs.
